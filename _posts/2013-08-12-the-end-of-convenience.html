<p>The end of convenience in modern society may sound scary.  No more 7 11&#039;s...no more take out boxes...no more all-in-one trash bins.  Nevertheless, it is a choice we must make, to limit our modern conveniences, if we wish to live a responsible and sustainable life.</p>
<p>It&#039;s not convenient to recycle.  It&#039;s not convenient to bring your own container to the store.  It&#039;s not convenient to take the stairs as opposed to the elevator.  There&#039;s hundreds of decisions we make every day that are based on convenience, and many of these convenient choices are putting our world and society in a worse state than it was when we arrived. </p>
<p>Try riding a bike instead of driving.  Pack your lunch instead of getting take out.  Carry your empty plastic water bottle in your bag until you can recycle it.  Better yet, always have a reusable water bottle and travel coffee mug so you don&#039;t ever use plastic bottles or styrofoam cups.  I could go on and on about sacrificing conveniences in order to make our society, our money and our health more sustainable, but you get the idea.  Now it&#039;s time to practice what I preach and take the stairs up to the 5th floor of my apartment instead of riding the elevator #already #wheezing.</p>
<p>Today I made a critical early decision in the year without plastic. I turned down a bag of bagels my room mate offered to buy and share, because they come in a plastic bag.  The quick and convenient solution to getting bagels is to say, &quot;yes pick me up a bag&quot;.  The very inconvenient solution is to go to the bakery and bring a container from home to put the bagels in.  How awkward and inconvenient that interaction will be.  I am looking forward to it. I look at it as a social experiment on convenience and the acceptance of environmentally friendly choices.</p>
