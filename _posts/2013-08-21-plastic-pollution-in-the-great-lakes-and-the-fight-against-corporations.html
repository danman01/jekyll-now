Plastic is not just invading our oceans, but is finding it&#039;s way to our fresh water lakes as well.  One recent discovery made by the 5 Gyres Institute in Lake Erie found more than 450,000 micro polyethylene beads per square kilometer.  Please excuse my switching from mile to KM in these articles.  We are going through a transition here in the US to the metric system, and it&#039;s one of the most difficult things I&#039;ve ever done.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about this discovery and the 5 Gyres Institute? The findings lead the institute to launch a massive grassroots campaign asking producers of these products (personal care products which contain plastic beads as an exfoliant) to eliminate plastic micro-beads in favor of natural alternatives.</p>
<p>&quot;After reporting their scientific findings to companies that utilize micro-beads, the 5 Gyres Insitute has won several key victories that will help protect the Great Lakes ecosystem. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lâ€™Oreal, The Body Shop and Colgate-Palmolive have all pledged to remove these synthetic beads from their products by 2015. The 5 Gyres Institute has also received a pledge from Proctor &amp; Gamble to phase out these beads by 2017, but the campaigning for an earlier phase-out continues.&quot; - <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2013/5-gyres-sets-sail-study-plastic-pollution-lake-michigan/">http://ecowatch.com/2013/5-gyres-sets-sail-study-plastic-pollution-lake-michigan/</a></p>
<p>This is awesome! Corporations are paying attention to their findings and the grassroots campaigns.  Here&#039;s a blog update from the 5 Gyres celebrating Victory #2 against Johnson &amp; Johnson: <a href="http://5gyres.org/posts/2013/06/04/victory_2/">http://5gyres.org/posts/2013/06/04/victory_2/</a> - Johnson &amp; Johnson will phase out the use of plastic micro-beads. </p>
<p>Check out this video the 5 Gyres Institute put together.  Over the course of four weeks, students and researchers lived and worked aboard a 200 year old sailing ship, conducting surface trawls and beach transects.  They made the startling discovery that plastic pollution is not limited to our oceans: <a href="http://vimeo.com/49330970#">5 Gyres Institute video</a></p>
