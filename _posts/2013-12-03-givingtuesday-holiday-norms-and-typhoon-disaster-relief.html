<p>I have done some light research into some of the organizations who are accepting donations (there's many), and have found a few that are doubling donations today. Apparently it's <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23givingtuesday&amp;src=typd">#GivingTuesday</a> every Tuesday in the month of December.  Many organizations are doubling contributions, doing giveaways, and providing other incentives to give. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.care.org/get-involved/giving-tuesday">CARE</a> is doubling donations, up to 1 million dollars, all through the month of December. </p>
<p>Partners in Health is doubling all donations today to support their work in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi">Malawi</a>: <a href="http://act.pih.org/Malawi-match">http://act.pih.org/Malawi-match</a> for #GivingTuesday</p>
<p>So go forth and give! </p>
<p>Today is also a good day to ask your friends, family and significant others to give to organizations on your behalf for the upcoming Christmas gift buying madness season. The alternative to donating on behalf of others, which I've done all throughout my life, is me rushing around to buy random things for people, and then blindly accepting starbucks gift cards and trinkets that likely will be stuffed away in a drawer for years to come.</p>
<p>How much money is wasted on things like gift cards that could go towards helping others? <a href="http://business.time.com/2012/01/09/billions-wasted-do-gift-cards-make-sense-when-so-many-go-unused/">TIME reports last year</a> that 2 billion dollars were wasted due to cards expiring or just going unused. Pretty crazy to think about!</p>
