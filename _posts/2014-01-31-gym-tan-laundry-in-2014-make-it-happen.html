<p>Setting a New Year&#039;s resolution is a chance for renewed energy, a clear mind, and a fresh perspective on our lives. So while accomplishing them may seem a little daunting, I definitely recommend the practice of setting them in writing.</p>
<p>Let&#039;s face it: everyone wants to go to the gym more, do more laundry or tanning...and the people that don&#039;t live up to their resolutions give the whole practice a bad reputation. &quot;The gym is too crowded&quot;, &quot;The laundromat scares me&quot;...enough excuses!</p>
<p>I say forget about all the people who complain and talk bad about setting new year&#039;s resolutions.  Anything that gets you motivated to live your ideal life is a great thing.  It should be practiced.  It won&#039;t be perfect the first few years...it might take a lifetime...but eventually you will get good at setting achievable new year&#039;s resolutions that really do make a positive impact on your life.</p>
<p>This year, I didn&#039;t set anything into writing until about mid-way through January.  But after I did (it took a whole 20 minutes or so), I&#039;ve definitely felt the energy that a new year brings.  A fresh start, a fresh outlook, and the opportunity to make this year a great one.</p>
<p>I felt like, instead of starting with action items, I would group some things into broader categories. Those turned out to be:</p>
<p>Healthy Mind<br />
Healthy Body<br />
Contribution to Social Good<br />
Planning for the Future<br />
Lifelong Skills to Prepare for the Zombie Apocalypse</p>
<p>The apocalypse could come at any time.  We really can&#039;t tell the future, but what we can do is prepare for the possibilities of what&#039;s to come.  I made sure to include apocalypse preparations in my 2014 New Year&#039;s resolutions.</p>
<p>Mind you, these are the ideals I set.  Will I achieve half of them? Time will tell...</p>
<p>Within the mind category:<br />
- meditation: every morning<br />
- reading: 30 mins a day<br />
- writing: 10 mins daily reflection and planning for the next day<br />
- yoga: every morning<br />
- buddhist practice</p>
<p>Within the body category:<br />
- yoga (apparently yoga is mind AND body!)<br />
- run / train for a 1/2 marathon<br />
- bike 50 mi / week<br />
- soccer 1x / week<br />
- vegetarian diet</p>
<p>Social Good:<br />
- Become a tutor / teacher<br />
- Volunteer at a food bank<br />
- Habitat 4 humanity<br />
- Year Without Plastic - Keep active on the blog (1 post per week) and Twitter, get engaged in the local farmer&#039;s market, do something like a video series.</p>
<p>Planning for the Future:<br />
- Expert-level ruby on rails / web developer<br />
- Contribute to open source project(s). 2-4 hours a week.<br />
- Join a company<br />
- Year w/o Plastic could fall into this category too, because I guess the well-being of the planet is important for the future.</p>
<p>Lifelong Skills for the Zombie Apocalypse:<br />
- farming / gardening (grow a window-sill herb garden for good eats while holed up from the zombies outside)<br />
- sailing (zombies can&#039;t walk on water)<br />
- teaching (maybe they won&#039;t attack the teacher?)<br />
- carpentry / electrician (build a fort and an electric fence around it)</p>
<p>So that&#039;s it! Have you written a list that you want to share? It may give me and some other folks ideas for their own 2014 goals, so share what you&#039;ve come up with, and if you don&#039;t have anything yet, try writing a list!</p>
