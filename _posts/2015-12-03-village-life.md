## About a week ago

I rolled into a quiet college town in eastern Connecticut called Willimantic. It's off of highway 6 that runs from Providence, RI all the way to around Hartford, CT. To Rhode Islanders, that's about halfway across the US.

I was coming back from spending Thanksgiving with friends and family around Cheshire, CT. Google maps offered us a variety of routes, and we chose the one that was a combination of no accidents, less mileage, and a road that we recognized. I also had highway 6 and Willimantic stuck in my mind, as I had read up on the [No Trash Project's blog](http://notrashproject.com/) about a little coop that had bulk everything. 

So off we went from Cheshire around 4pm, with the sun already setting. Not that the dimming sunlight mattered anyways, as there was pretty heavy cloud coverage that showered rain every so often. Within an hour, it was pretty dark on our highway road through small town Connecticut. I wondered if we were going through Willimantic, which I memorized earlier as being off of route 6. I asked my co-pilot Erin to search for a food co-op in Willimantic, just to see where it was. "Willimantic Food Coop" was a nice search term, and turns out was the name of the store! Also, it was right off of route 6. No-Plastic Adventure Time awaits! 

We drove into the 'village' (nowhere else in the US besides New England do we have villages), past Eastern Connecticut University, a few blocks into the main street district, and parked outside a normal looking bottle shop / food co-op. 

As we entered, the young co-op employee / volunteer / members greeted us warmly. My eyes gazed at the array of fruits and veggies before me, and I started into the store like a killer whale into a pack of baby seals. We found a large Kohlrabi (cool Rabbi?) for a nice price, but didn't opt for much other fresh fruits and veggies. 

We were here on a mission: to find bulk stuff and things normally not available unless they're packaged or plastic wrapped. As I entered the bulk section, I remember thinking, "This is it. this is what a store should be. If it's possible here, it's possible anywhere".

With a village population of just over 17,000 people, and a store about the size of a Blockbuster Video, Willimantic Food Co-op had created a bulk section that rivalled the largest markets in Austin, TX, Boulder, CO, San Francisco, CA, and insert_affluent_hippy_town, USA. We filled up on bulk tea ( Earl Grey and some blend for women's health ), bulk coconut flakes and chips, whole wheat pastas, flax seeds, and some turbanido sugar, all available with paper bags. We fantasized about bulk honey, olive oil and kambucha, but didn't want to splurge on a plastic or glass container. Next time we'll bring our own plastic and glass reusable containers so we won't have to purchase any or use paper bags. Anything we could ever want for our routine vegetarian diet and cookie / baking habit could be acquired within about 200 sq feet of this humble co-op, all available package-free. Over in the refrigerated section, they had bulk tofu, raw milk in containers that begged to be brought back for a discount, and local eggs (not sure about container reuse for those).

In the cleaning and hygeine department, there was bulk lotion, soaps, baking soda and cleaning supplies. There is no excuse for buying any plastic bottle of these home essentials when they are available right here, ready to go into an old container. We stocked up on unwrapped shampoo bars for $4.99 a piece ($3 cheaper than Whole Paycheck). We admired the package-free sponges, geeked out on the dispensers of cleaning liquids, and mentally catalouged many items for a return trip.

At the register, we were prepared to pay the non co-op-member price of 10% above sticker, but as luck would have it, during the holidays everyone receives the member price. Fortune smiles upon thee!

Filled with endorphines that only bulk shopping can bring on, we left the store, waving goodbye to the workers, and smiling as we marched through the rain to the car. The next stop would be a few blocks over where we erroniously thought a friends' band was playing at a record store. We discovered Main Street has nothing opened past 7pm on a Saturday night. We hung out outside a closed record shop, wondering where the band was. Then we had the genius idea to check Facebookâ„¢, and noted the updated event time of two weeks into the future. Perfect. Another adventure to the co-op is already in the works.

P.S: Willimantic has frogs on spools of thread guarding a bridge

P.P.S: There's a [brewing company](http://www.willimanticbrewingcompany.com/) on main street that we somehow missed
